# Car Racing Simulation UDP Telemetry

![NodeMCU ESP8266 with 16 RGB LEDs](./images/ESP8266_RGB_LEDs.jpg)

Popular car racing simulators send car telemetry via UDP packets. This allows
third party programs and devices to access real-time information such as engine
speed, RPM, temperature, etc.

The repo has some examples using an ESP8266 to drive LEDs based on RPM. Two
games are supported: "Project Cars 2" and "F1 2020".

Parts

Quantity    |Description
------------|-----------
1           |NodeMCU 1.0 ESP8266 board
2           |8 RGB LED stick

Connection Table for RGB LEDs

NodeMCU     |WS2812     |Description
------------|-----------|-----------
G           |GND        |Ground (Blue wire)
3V3         |VCC        |3.3 Volt Power (Orange wire)
RX          |IN         |Arduino GPIO#3 (Yellow wire)

Connecting the WS2812 LEDs this way may not always work because the LEDs are
designed for 5 Volt power and logic levels. But 3.3 Volt works on most of the
time. And this eliminates the need for logic level converters. If you want
maximum brightness, use 5 Volts and logic level converters. The number
of LEDs is limited by the ESP8266 board 3.3V voltage regulator.

The two 8 RGB sticks are soldered together to form one 16 RGB stick. Flexible
strips and rings can be used instead.
